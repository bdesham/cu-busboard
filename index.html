<p>CU Buses is a small application that tells you when buses will be arriving at a certain stop on the Champaign–Urbana Mass Transit District (<abbr>CUMTD</abbr>) bus system. CU Buses runs in Dashboard, which is part of Mac OS X—you’ll need a Mac to use this widget.</p>

</section>

<section id="installation">

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><a href="#download">Download the widget</a> from this page, and double-click on the “CU Buses.wdgt” file that appears in your downloads folder. You will be taken to the Dashboard, and you’ll see the back of the CU Buses widget. Click the “Keep” button and enter the four-digit <abbr>CUMTD</abbr> text message code for the stop you’d like to monitor. Click “Done” and you’re all set!</p>

<p>If you’d like, you can also tell CU Buses to show only certain bus routes. From the preferences screen, click “Choose…” and uncheck the boxes for any routes you don’t want to see. (In this screen several <abbr>MTD</abbr> routes may be covered under one checkbox—for example, checking the “1 Yellow” box will show you information for the 1N and 1S Yellow, the 1N and 1S YellowHopper, the 100N and 100S Yellow Evening, and so on.)</p>

<section id="tips">

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul class="tips">

<li>You can return to CU Buses’ preferences screen by clicking on the <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: italic">“i”</span> button that appears when you move your cursor over the widget.</li>

<li>Since you’ll probably want to monitor a couple of stops at a time, you can have multiple copies of CU Buses in your Dashboard. While in Dashboard, press the white “+” button in the lower-left corner of the screen and drag the CU Buses icon out into your Dashboard. You can have as many copies of the widget as you’d like.</li>

<li>If you hold your cursor over a route name, a tooltip will appear showing that route’s destination.</li>

<li>The widget will automatically check for new versions. Flip to the back of the widget periodically to see whether a new version is available—a green “Get the newest version” button will be visible.</li>

</ul>
